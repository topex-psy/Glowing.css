# Glowing.css
a simple pure CSS to make PNG or anything glow! It can be applied to divs, texts, links, inputs, buttons, PNG image, and so on. You can use it and/or modify it freely according to your need.

It's originally created for my PokoPoko fun social media project. But then I considering to share it with anyone. XD

### [Demo! >w<](https://topex-psy.github.io/Glowing.css/)

## How To Use

It's simple! You'll have to include glowing.css in your project. Example:

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/glowing.css"/>
</head>
```

Then just add class "glowing" to your HTML element of choice, then add the color e.g. "glowing blue".

There are many other color options available: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `cyan`, `lightblue`, `blue`, `darkblue`, `indigo`, `purple`, `magenta`, `pink`.

#### So this is how your element tag will look like:

```html
<img src="img/facebook.png" class="glowing darkblue"/>`
```

## Want more that that?

Glowing.css have some more secret classes:
`disco`
`zooming`
`rotating`
`quickly`

### You can try it yourself: ^_^

```html
<div class="glowing disco and quickly zooming">
<img src="img/yourlogo.png"/> Your name here
</div>
```
  
Good luck! :sparkling_heart:
